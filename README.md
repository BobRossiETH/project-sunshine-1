# project-sunshine
This is the repo for https://ethsunshine.com, a site to monitor the Ethereum Network's decentralization health.

## Introduction & Purpose
Maintaining diversity of clients is a key security factor of any decentralized blockchain. Ethereum is currently running two networks at the same time - the Execution Layer (EL) containing the traditional PoW chain and the Consensus Layer (CL) containing the new released PoS chain. As it stands today, the EL has 100% of block proposals coming from the 'Geth' client. The CL has 4 clients of varying popularity, however 'Prysm' is the largest at >50% of the network. For perspective, the next highest client is around 29%.

The purpose of project-sunshine is to identify a scoring system for centralization vectors, set target scores for each vector, and then work with the community to meet those target scores. 

Information on different aspects of client diversity is often scattered across multiple sites and sources. This project would bring all that data into one easy-to-reference website.  Taking all the client diversity data and combining it with the decentralization goals should create a powerful tool for the community to more effectively push for client diversity.

## Currently Proposed Centralization Vectors
Below is the list of currently proposed centralization vectors to set and monitor goals for:
1) Consensus Client Diversity
2) Execution Client Diversity
3) Data Center Validators (Hosted versus Non-Hosted)
4) Government Entity Stake Weight
5) Largest Entity Stake Weight 
6) Geolocation Diversity

## Community Input
Project-Sunshine is always welcoming community input! Below are some ways to help out with the project!
- Additional centralization vectors to track / goals to set
- Sources to pull client diversity data from
- Ideas to help reach the stated client diversity goals
